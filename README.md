# Neural Network for Image Classification

This repository contains code for image classification using a neural network with two different approaches: extracting all pixels and using pre-trained models.

## Approach 1: Extract All Pixels

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Download the dataset `homer_bart_1.zip` and place it in the appropriate directory (`/content/drive/MyDrive/Computer Vision Masterclass/Datasets/` in the provided code).

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
2. Run the code cells or script.
3. The code will extract pixels from the images, preprocess them, and then train a neural network for image classification.
4. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## File Structure

- `image_classification.ipynb` (or `image_classification.py`): Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
- `homer_bart_1.zip`: Dataset containing images of Homer and Bart Simpson (download and place in the appropriate directory).
- `README.md`: This file.
